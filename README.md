Mod for Fun with Ragdolls: The Game

[Installation instructions](https://github.com/coolymike/FWR-QoL-Mod/wiki/Installation-Guide)

Full changelog:
```
1.0.0:
Added ability to fly in play mode
Added rotating in other axis (Default controls: C, V, B, N)
Added Un-flying in mid air (Default button: P)
Added rotating objects by smaller amounts (Default button: I)
1.1.0:
Removed grid placement (Default key: O)
Game now skips the intro (Can be changed in settings)
2 Custom colors for floor/items (Have to be changed in settings)
Black is now black instead of dark gray
1 second wait when loading a world has been removed
Nukes have been added (have to enable in settings)
1.2.0:
If Color Code Ragdolls is turned off, ragdolls will now spawn with "Special skins"
Removed "Sneaking" functionality and instead bound superspeed to shift (or whatever it is set to in game settings)
Fixed the "Exit Game" button (in the main menu)
mod_settings.txt resets itself with any future updates, please remove the old file and start the game to get a proper copy.
Added G, H, and J as buttons to restrict your build mode placement (Good for when you have the grid disabled)
1.3.0:
Added Custom Gravity option (which doesn't work on vanilla game)
"Added" Cinematic Camera (Default Key: U)
Added option for lasers to be on permanently
Added toggle to add walking slowly back into the game
Fixed bug that would cause the world to appear white when mod_settings.txt doesn't exist
1.4.0:
Added unused lines back in the tutorial
Added destructible objects breaking semi-realistically
Changed Name
1.5.0:
Added God Mode (enable in mod_settings)
Added Scaling objects!
How to change the size of an object:
Hold M, K, and or L for X, Y, and Z scaling
Use the mouse scrollwheel to scale up and down
Press Y to reset scale
1.6.0:
Added option to have physics on build objects (enable in mod settings "ForcePhysics")
Added custom slow motion time scale (can break the game with values that are too extreme)
Added custom scale increase (for even bigger objects/more detailed scale)
Changed how scaling works, using the scrollwheel now changes the scale of an object even without holding M, K, or L. Holding any of those keys scales it along only X, Y, and or Z respectively
Changed ResetScaleKey to not only reset the scale, but also the rotation of an object
1.6.1:
Changed physics toggle to be on a key (Default "1" on top row)
Scroll wheel can now be used to change the distance you're holding objects at in play mode
Fixed bug where physics objects would spawn slightly below the intended spawnpoint
Internal changes
1.6.3:
Added full world scaling
1.6.4:
Added full world physics
1.7.0:
Added AntiTouchObject toggle (Default button: 2)
What this does is when a physics enabled build object also has this, touching the object will make ragdolls and the player go into ragdoll mode.
Added NavMeshSize (set in mod_settings, default 1.0), which makes the "ragdolls are stupid beyond this point" signs not valid as increasing the value will make the ragdolls smart for a bigger area.
1.8.0:
Added Discord Rich Presence
```
